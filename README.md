# The Loot Game

/// RULES ///

/\_ In this game the first player who will reach at 100 points wins the game!

Player #1 presses the ROLL button and starts roll a dice as many times as he wants. The numbers of the dice are stacking in a temporary Board for each player at each player's turn. When the player "feel comfortable", must press the HOLD button. Then, the points from his temporary Board will be saved on his main Board and then ends his turn and plays the Player #2.

IF a Player rolls the dice and displays the number '1', this player LOSES his
turn and ALL OF HIS CURRENT POINTS !!!
